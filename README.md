This website is designed for maintaining Mid-Day meals scheme of the government. At present this scheme is maintained via teachers in papers which causes huge burden on them and even fraud.
First, a school needs to be registered with initial stock present in their school and previous month's indent that was sent to mid day meal authority(This entry is directly made into the transaction table in the database for the registered school but site has to developed to include that feature)

Once the school logs in using the credentials  made during registration, it gets following options:

1.Transaction-
a)The details regarding the number of students who took the meals has to be entered. The government has fixed the quantity of rice, dal, oil, milk powder and other items that should be served to each student.(This quantity is assumed and fixed in the code )Thus this quantities will be calculated automatically and that particular day's 		transaction details will entered in the transaction table and the spent quantities will be reduced in the stock of that school.
b)All previous transactions i.e day-to-day expenditure can also viewed.

2.View stock-the present stock in that school can be viewed, and once the grant made by the authority reaches the school, "Stock Reached " button can be clicked that will update the stock in that school and remove the entry from "Not reached grant " table ,so that the mid day meal officer gets to know that the stock has reached the school.

3.View grants -All grants made for that school by the admin will be displayed, so now once the stock has reached the school ,school teachers can verify the grant that was made and the stock reaching the school. Thus this removed any "Fraud" that would occur.

4.View Indents -All the automatically placed indents on behalf of the school can be viewed. When the stock in that school goes down by the amount that is required to serve their school students for one week, this indent (which essentially sums up rice,daal and other ingredients that was spent in the previous month)will be placed in front of mid day meal authority. Thus removes the burden on teachers to overview the stock and preparation of the indent.


Once the admin logs in he has following options

1.View Indents-All the indents placed by the schools under his concern can be viewed and he can  make the grant accordingly to each school.

2.View Grants-All grants that are made so far by him to each school can be viewed.

3.View Not Reached Grants-All the grants that are made but have not reached the schools can be viewed here.Thus he will be able to trace the stock released for each school.

This site is made to run for one district because of the time constraints but can scaled up work all districts.
